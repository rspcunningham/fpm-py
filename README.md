Fourier ptychography is a computational image reconstruction technique that allows one high-resolution microscopic image to be acquired by combining multiple lower-resolution images captured at differing optical illumination angles.

More information about Fourier ptychography can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_ptychography).

## Installation

```bash
pip install fpm-py
```

## Upcoming

1. More `optimizer` and `iteration_terminator`s
2. Complete documentation
3. Public 10k+ image dataset
4. Performance metrics, to assess how well the resulting reconstruction worked.
5. Full testing
